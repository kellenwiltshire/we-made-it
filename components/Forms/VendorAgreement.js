							We Made It rents out retail space to over 70+ makers. Vendors make
							back 100% of their sales.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our team members ring all products through a till using a barcode
							scanner. All items are individually labeled with a barcode sticker
							by the maker, which includes an item name, price and barcode.
							Vendors are to provide a properly completed inventory sheet to the
							store 24 hours before bringing in product, allowing our team to
							have your labels ready for you to label your items when you
							arrive. *Product will not be sold without a label
							<p>
								**During Christmas hours, we will make exceptions to this rule,
								allowing makers to add their own labels to products (using the
								same SKU). Vendors are still required to send the properly
								filled inventory sheet PRIOR to arriving, so we have time to
								import the items into the system.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								We charge the customer – not the vendor – a 13% admin fee on
								every transaction. This is not tax (tax is charged on your
								rental space). This helps pay for Point-of-Sale fees,
								housekeeping and supplies. This also allows us to keep rent as
								low as possible for Vendors.
							</p>

							<p>
								If your business is required to charge tax, you are responsible
								for including that in your cost. We cannot charge tax on your
								items for you.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							Vendors are responsible for tracking their own inventory and
							keeping the store stocked at all times.

							Vendors are permitted to schedule Pop-Up Shop, allowing them to
