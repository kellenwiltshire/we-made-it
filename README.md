We Made It

We Made It is a Handmade Boutique retailer with an online presence. The site integrates with the Square API to show products and allow for searching of those products. The site is created with NextJS with a NodeJS backend to mange API requests. The Website allows users to browse the stores selection and make purchases through Square. This site was created to allow the owner to make sure their online store reflected their in-person store. The site utilizes ISR on the shop page so that it is up-to-date (within 1 hour) of any changes made on the Square inventory and to allow for lightning fast product sorting.
