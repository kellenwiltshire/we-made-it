## Lessons Learned

This was the first site I made for a Client. The site was originally a store front for a Merchant Servicer called Square. It has since moved from Square to Shopify which allowed me to learn GraphQL.

The project is built with NextJS and utilizies both ISR and SSR to make sure that the site is fast and responsive while maintaining great SEO. 

Unfortunately the Client's expectations had changed and they decided to use Shopify's website builder. The lower cost and greater cohesiveness with the Shopify tools fit their needs better at the current time. This was still a great learning experience working with my first Client.
